"""Volume photon step — per-DOM survival for string-telescope detectors.

Replaces the single-surface photon_step for volume detectors where DOMs
float in the medium at different distances along the photon ray. Each DOM
gets its own reach probability based on its distance from the photon origin.

No reflection — photons either scatter in the medium, are absorbed, or
are detected by a DOM. The detection weight per DOM is the implicit-capture
(Rao-Blackwellised) expected charge:

    charge_j = overlap(d_perp_j) × exp(-d_j · mu_tot) × exp(-d_j / λ_abs)

where exp(-d·mu_tot) is the probability of remaining on the ray to distance d
(``mu_tot`` = combined Rayleigh+Mie scatter rate) and exp(-d/λ_abs) is the
absorption survival. These are kept separate to support independent wavelength
dependence.

Gradient design — this is a DiCE-forward citizen, mirroring the water
``photon_step``:
  * TRACK params flow PATHWISE — geometry (per-DOM distances, direction,
    position) is kept LIVE, so the deposit and the carried position/time carry
    the track gradient.
  * OPTICAL scatter-rate/asymmetry params (λ_R, λ_M, g) flow through the DiCE
    SCORE (``logp_increment`` = free-path log-prob + Mie/Rayleigh angle log-prob),
    with the sampled free path ``d`` and the cos-angles DETACHED inside the score
    so it carries optical gradients only (via the live ``mu_tot``/``p_mie``/``g``
    coefficients). The increment is accumulated into ``PhotonState.log_p`` and the
    scan body folds ``dice_dep = exp(log_p − sg(log_p))`` into each future deposit.
    The sampled free path is detached for the trajectory (``new_position`` uses
    ``sg(d)``), so the optical gradient does NOT take the high-variance pathwise
    route through the discrete DOM-candidate selection — it rides the score.
  * λ_abs flows PATHWISE through the deposit / continuing weight (a deterministic
    attenuation, not a sampled decision — exact and low-variance).

Two-channel scatter combines λ_R and λ_M by RATE: mu_tot = 1/λ_R + 1/λ_M,
p_mie = (1/λ_M)/mu_tot.

The step returns ``logp_increment``; the simulator's volume branch applies the
pre-step ``dice_dep`` to the deposit and accumulates ``log_p``.
