"""Calibrating a detector: the one call, and the closure that tells you whether to trust it.

The parameterisation, forward, Jacobian, problem and loop are separate objects so that each can
be reviewed alone. This module assembles them once, so a first fit does not start from a copied
figure script and inherit whatever that script happened to do.

Two entry points, and the order matters:

``closure``    generate data from parameters you chose, perturb, fit, and see what comes back.
               Do this FIRST on any new detector. It is the only way to distinguish a broken
               configuration from a genuinely hard one, and it costs nothing but compute — the
               truth is known because you set it.
``calibrate``  the same fit against real data.

``fit`` is the field-based driver: the same machinery reached through
:func:`lucid.fitting.problem.build_calibration_problem`, which parameterises the fit by naming
``DetectorParams`` leaf fields rather than by the published estimand's fixed layout.

The estimator
-------------
One estimator serves all three:

* **Neyman χ²** residual ``(k·M − Q)/√Q``. The weight depends on the data alone. That is not a
  detail — the forward is a Monte-Carlo estimate redrawn every step, so any weight involving the
  model makes the residual nonlinear in it and permanently displaces the fixed point.
* **Profiled gains.** The per-PMT factor is solved in closed form each step (``k = ΣQ/ΣM``,
  see :func:`lucid.fitting.calib.profile_gains` for how that differs from the Neyman minimiser)
  rather than fitted. Order 10^4 nuisance parameters never enter the optimizer.
* **Damped Gauss-Newton**, shared with reconstruction (:mod:`lucid.fitting.gn`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim : callable
        ``sim(source, detector_params, key) -> (charge, time)``, from
        ``setup_event_simulator(..., is_calibration=True, hit_mode='aggregated')``.
    sources : sequence
        The calibration sources. Source 0 is the singleton in the sharded dispatch; that affects
        execution only, never the result.
    params : parameterisation
        :class:`~lucid.fitting.params.CalibrationParams` for the published estimand, or
        :class:`~lucid.fitting.params.FieldParams` to fit named ``DetectorParams`` leaves.
    data : array ``(S, n_sensors)``
        Observed charge, rows ordered ``g = wl*n_sources + s`` to match the forward. With a single
        wavelength that is simply one row per source.
    theta0 : array ``(P,)``
        Starting fit vector.
    steps, lam, mu, max_step, refresh, lr, scale, readout, polyak, fix
        Passed through to :func:`lucid.fitting.gn.gauss_newton`; see it for the conventions.
    tx : optax.GradientTransformation or None
        None (the default) runs the published damped Gauss-Newton path unchanged, byte for byte.
        Supplying a transformation routes the same problem through
        :func:`lucid.fitting.minimize.minimize` instead, so any optax optimiser can fit this
        problem -- including the Gauss-Newton one, as
        ``damped_gauss_newton(lam, mu, learning_rate=...)``. ``lam``/``mu``/``jitter``/``lr``
        configure the Gauss-Newton STEP, so passing them alongside ``tx`` raises rather than
        silently double-applying or ignoring them.
    needs_metric : bool
        Whether ``tx`` consumes the metric. Leave True for curvature-aware transformations. Note
        that False does not avoid building it here: this problem's gradient IS ``Jᵀr``, so there
        is no gradient without the Jacobian and a first-order rule saves nothing on calibration.
    n_forward_draws : int
        Forward draws averaged into the residual each step. Averaging reduces the Monte-Carlo
        variance of the model. The Neyman residual is linear in ``M``, so on its own averaging
        would not move the fixed point; the knob matters because the profiled gain
        ``k = ΣQ/ΣM`` is nonlinear in ``M``. See :func:`~lucid.fitting.calib.profile_gains`.
    jacobian_draws : int
        Jacobian draws averaged per refresh, on a stream independent of the residual's.
    q_floor, q_floor_frac
        Floor on the Neyman weight's denominator, absolute or as a fraction of ``mean(data)``.
        It exists because ``1/sqrt(Q)`` diverges on an empty sensor: without it a handful of nearly
        unlit sensors dominate the fit.
    frac : float
        Fractional uncertainty added to the Neyman variance, ``clip(Q, floor) + (frac·Q)²``: the
        bright-sensor counterpart of ``q_floor``, capping each sensor's pull at about ``1/frac²``
        counts (see :func:`lucid.fitting.calib.neyman_variance`). 0 (default) is unchanged.
    gauge : ``'log'`` or ``'linear'``
        Gain gauge; see :func:`lucid.fitting.calib.profile_gains`.
    seed : int
        Selects both key streams. Vary it to build an ensemble.
    predict, map_fn
        Forward dispatch overrides; see :class:`~lucid.fitting.calib.CalibrationForward`.
    forward : CalibrationForward or None
        A forward built earlier, to be reused rather than rebuilt. Purely a cost argument: a
        caller that already has one — because it generated its own data with
        :func:`closure_data`, as the paper driver does — would otherwise pay a second trace and
        compile of the identical computation. Ignored by the answer; validated against ``data``.
