"""Calibration forward model: predicted per-sensor charge for every source × wavelength.

The calibration counterpart of :class:`lucid.fitting.recon.ReconModel`.

Preserved expression for expression from the paper's reference calibration engine. The whole
stack runs in float32 (``jax_enable_x64`` is never enabled), so an equivalent but re-associated
expression can move the result. The reference engine is not in this repository, so no shipped
test gates that agreement. Anything here that looks gratuitously specific (the key arithmetic,
the concatenate-then-transpose, the laser/isotropic split) is load-bearing for that reason.

Layout
------
``S = W * n_sources`` configurations, indexed ``g = wl * n_sources + s`` — wavelength-major, so
each row of the returned ``(S, NS)`` array is one (wavelength, source) pair.

Two dispatch routes
-------------------
Sources reach the simulator two ways, and the difference is not stylistic. The reference passes
each source as a **pytree of arrays**, so one compiled program serves all of them with the source
as a traced argument — that is what makes a ``pmap`` over sources possible at all. The field-based
bridge (:func:`lucid.fitting.problem.build_calibration_problem`) instead hands over one **closure
per source**, which cannot be traced and therefore gets its own compiled program.

Both routes run the same key arithmetic, the same assembly, and the same estimator downstream.
Only the compilation strategy differs, but in float32 that does not make the answers identical:
the forward agrees exactly, while the Jacobian differs at float32 epsilon because XLA folds a
closed-over source as a constant where the other route carries it as a traced argument. Gated by
``tests/test_fitting_calibrate.py::test_the_two_dispatch_routes_agree``. The traced route is the
default; the per-source route is selected by passing ``predict``.

Sharding
--------
The reference dispatches source 0 (a collimated laser) to one device and the remaining isotropic
sources to a ``pmap``. That is an execution strategy, not physics, so it is injected via
``map_fn`` rather than baked in. The default is a serial loop over sources, which is also what
the reference itself falls back to below 7 devices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim : callable
        ``sim(source, detector_params, key) -> (charge, time)``, from
        ``setup_event_simulator(..., is_calibration=True, hit_mode='aggregated')``.
    sources : sequence
        Calibration sources. Source 0 is treated as the "singleton" (the laser in the reference
        layout) and the rest as the mappable group — this only affects dispatch, not the result.
    params : parameterisation, or None
        Supplies ``W`` and ``to_dp`` (:mod:`lucid.fitting.params`). May be ``None`` only when
        ``predict`` is given, in which case ``to_dp`` is never called and ``W`` defaults to 1.
    n_sensors : int
    map_fn : callable or None
        ``map_fn(fn, in_axes)`` returning a batched callable over the non-singleton sources.
        ``None`` (default) uses a serial loop that is numerically identical.
    predict : callable or None
        ``predict(theta, source, wl, gains, key) -> (n_sensors,)``, replacing the default
        composition ``sim(source, params.to_dp(theta, wl, gains), key)[0]``. Giving it selects the
        per-source route (see the module docstring): sources are then opaque Python objects rather
        than traced pytrees, so each gets its own compiled program and ``map_fn`` does not apply.
        This is how a list of ready-made forward closures is fitted.

    There is one gain per sensor (order 10^4 of them). Fitting them jointly would swamp the
    handful of optical parameters that are actually of interest, so they are profiled out at every
    step in closed form, at the cost of one division.

    ``ΣQ/ΣM`` is the exact minimiser of an UNWEIGHTED least squares (equivalently the Poisson
    scale MLE). It is NOT the minimiser of the Neyman chi-square this module actually forms in
    :func:`neyman_residual`, which is ``ΣM / Σ(M²/Q)``. Worked example: ``M=(1,10)``, ``Q=(2,10)``
    gives ``k=1.0909`` and ``chi2=0.4959`` here against ``k=1.0476`` and ``chi2=0.4762`` at the
    true Neyman minimum -- 4.1% higher. Two consequences follow and neither is cosmetic. The
    reported ``loss`` is not the profiled minimum; and since ``dchi2/dk = +0.909 != 0`` at this
    ``k``, the envelope theorem does NOT hold, so dropping ``dk/dtheta`` from the Jacobian (a
    deliberate choice, documented at :class:`CalibrationJacobian`) omits a genuinely non-zero
    term rather than a vanishing one.

    This is the published estimator and it is consistent -- ``E[r] = 0`` at truth for any gain
    map -- so the discrepancy is recorded rather than fixed. Changing ``k`` would move every
    published number.

    The gauge removes the exact degeneracy between a global gain and the overall light yield —
    without it the two directions are unidentifiable.

    ``'log'``    ``mean(log k) = 0``  — what the published run used.
    ``'linear'`` ``mean(k) = 1``      — ``k̂ = ΣQ/ΣM`` is linear in the data and therefore
                 unbiased, whereas taking its log first incurs a Jensen shift that is larger on
                 dim sensors. Not the published choice; adopting it would move published numbers.

    scalar likelihood, with a Fisher metric built separately — which is why the loop is written
    against ``(g, H, loss)`` and not against residuals.

    Three things this class owns that the loop must not:

    * **The keys.** The residual's forward is redrawn every step from one stream; the Jacobian
      draws from another, which must be independent of it (shared keys correlate J with r) and
      must carry the seed (see :meth:`CalibrationJacobian.key`).
    * **The nuisance.** Per-PMT gains are profiled in closed form each step, so they never enter
      the optimizer. This is why calibration needs no Schur block in the fitter, and therefore why
      one loop can serve both problems at all.
    * **Step application.** ``accumulate`` keeps the iterate in the dtype the reference uses. The
      stack is float32 throughout, and a step applied in float64 gives a different trajectory.
