"""Drive the angular-response measurement over the 3 MeV electron sample.

The reduction lives in :mod:`lucid.production.fitqun.angular`; this is the part
that produces its inputs. It takes the shared isotropic sample (see
:mod:`lucid.production.fitqun.isotropic_sample`), propagates it through LUCiD,
and hands the reduction the four per-photon quantities it needs: the emission
point, the sensor that was hit, that sensor's position and its inward axis.

Two selections carry over from the reference and are applied here rather than
left to the caller:

* **Direct light only.** ``angularResponsePlotter.cc`` skips every photon with
  ``isct != 0``. LUCiD now reports the same thing per photon, so the cut is
  ``~indirect`` -- no second production, no physics-config gymnastics.
* **The shell.** Only photons whose emission point lies in a thin spherical
  shell about the sensor are kept, so ``Omega(R)`` and ``T(R)`` are common to
  every entry and the cos(eta) spectrum is the angular response alone.

Statistics: the reference reuses the ~1e8-event indirect-light sample, and the
shell cut keeps a small fraction of it, so this is not a cheap measurement. Run
it on the same files the scattering table uses rather than generating a second
sample.
