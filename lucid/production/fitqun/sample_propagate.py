"""Propagate the reference's electron-bomb photons through the detector.

``scattab_nuPRISM_mPMT.mac`` fires 3 MeV electrons one per event, uniformly in
the detector volume and isotropically in direction, and the tables are built
from the Cherenkov photons those electrons make. This module is the LUCiD half
of that: PhotonSim produces the photon list, and this propagates it.

Why not let the shotgun sample its own photons: it emits one direction per
case, so a case lands on a single sensor and contributes one (source, sensor)
geometry. An electron emits a Cherenkov cone across a ring of sensors, which is
where the angular response gets its independent samples. The marginal
distributions agree either way; the correlation structure does not, and it is
the correlation structure the angular response is made of.

The vertex is applied here rather than in PhotonSim: PhotonSim has no
volume-sampling command, so the gun sits at the origin and
:func:`isotropic_sample.translate_uniform` moves each *event* to its own
uniformly drawn point -- the same distribution ``/gps/pos/type Volume`` gives.
