"""Per-event truth for comparing a reconstruction against the simulation.

LUCiD splits truth across two modalities, and neither alone is enough:

* ``labl`` carries the interaction vertex, the primary PDG codes and the primary
  energies. Format v6 adds ``per_track/dir_{x,y,z}``; this reader still derives
  direction from ``step`` so it works on v5 datasets too.
* ``step`` carries per-segment ``start``/``dir``/``beta_start`` and a track index,
  but no PDG.

Two things about this were established by measurement, because guessing either
one silently corrupts every resolution:

**The primary is ``track_idx == 0``**, not the track named by
``primary_track_ids_data``. On a single-muon event that field reads 1, and track 1
is a delta ray: 20 segments beginning 3 cm off the vertex, beta 0.79, about one
Cherenkov photon each. Track 0 has 5264 segments, starts exactly at the labl
vertex, holds a stable direction and emits ~90 photons per segment.

**``primary_energies_data`` is KINETIC energy.** A pion event reads 200.33 MeV
where its mass is 139.6 and the generator draws kinetic energy from 200 MeV up,
so the field cannot be a total energy. The two readings then agree: for a muon at
beta = 0.9973 the momentum from beta is 1434.8 MeV/c and from the kinetic energy
1432.0 MeV/c, a 0.2% difference. Momentum is taken from the energy (exact) and
beta is kept as a consistency check.

Positions are METRES here, as LUCiD stores them; the fiTQun comparison converts.
