"""Photosensor angular response epsilon(cos eta) — the ``angRespAll_<r>`` input.

fiTQun factorises the geometric term of the predicted charge as
``J = Omega(R) * T(R) * epsilon(cos eta)`` (``fiTQun.cc::J``), where ``Omega``
is the *unprojected* solid angle of the sensor face and ``epsilon`` carries
everything that depends on the angle of incidence — the projection of the face
onto the line of sight and whatever the photocathode does to light arriving
off-normal.

The reference measurement (``Utilities/angular/angularResponsePlotter_v1.C``)
isolates it by taking direct photons only and keeping just those whose source
sits in a thin spherical shell of radius ``r`` about the sensor: at fixed ``R``
both ``Omega(R)`` and ``T(R)`` are constant, so the ``cos eta`` spectrum of
detected photons *is* ``epsilon`` up to normalisation, which is fixed by
setting the normal-incidence bin to 1.

This module is the same reduction against LUCiD photons. Two things the caller
owns:

* **Direct light only.** The reference uses a WCSim fork that kills scattered
  and reflected photons; the LUCiD equivalent is to run the source scan with
  scattering and reflection off in the physics config.
* **Containment.** A shell is only usable if it lies entirely inside the
  detector, or the missing solid angle biases the spectrum. :func:`measure`
  enforces this the same way the reference does, from the detector extent.

The output is the histogram; the ``TPolyFunc`` fit that turns it into
``angResp_<config>.root`` stays with ``Utilities/angular/fit_cos.C``, which
owns the piecewise-polynomial form fiTQun expects.

    means adding the counts, so normalisation is left to :func:`normalise`.

    The containment cut below keeps a shell only around sensors clear of the
    surface that would clip it, so each radius is measured at its own subset of
    sensors and carries its own statistics. That does not change *what* is
    measured: epsilon is a property of the sensor, so the radii should agree
    within errors. A radius that comes out empty or truncated means the sources
    never reached it -- which is a bug in the sample, not a property of the
    method. ``fit_cos.C`` fits a single hardcoded ``angRespAll_100``, so the
    100 cm shell in particular has to be populated; that is what requires the
    sources to fill the volume out to the sensor faces (see
    :func:`lucid.production.fitqun.isotropic_sample.translate_uniform`).

    Entries are per photon with unit weight, as the reference fills them
    (``totalPe`` is hardcoded to 1 there). Photons from one event that land on
    one sensor share a cos(eta) exactly, so they are one correlated lump and
    sqrt(N) understates the error -- measured at 3.6-8.5x on the 1e8-electron
