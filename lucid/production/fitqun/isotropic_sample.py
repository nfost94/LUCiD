"""The 3 MeV electron sample that feeds the angular response and the scattering table.

Both tables come from the *same* MC production in the reference chain. Ryo's
description of it:

    We generate 3 MeV electrons at uniformly distributed positions in the
    detector and with uniformly distributed directions. From the truth
    information in the simulation, we select only the indirect light and create
    a six-dimensional table. [...] For the angular response we reuse the
    simulation samples generated for the indirect light table.

So this module produces one photon-level sample and hands it to both
reductions. The pieces that make that possible:

* PhotonSim fires the electrons and returns every Cherenkov photon's emission
  point and direction -- ``oppos``/``opdir`` in the reference's vocabulary. A
  3 MeV electron ranges about 1.5 cm in water, so those points sit essentially
  at the vertex, but they are taken from the simulation rather than assumed.
* LUCiD propagates that photon list through the real detector via
  :func:`lucid.sources.shotgun_source.shotgun_source`, which accepts per-photon
  origins and directions.
* The propagation now reports, per detected photon, whether it scattered or
  reflected on the way (``per_photon/indirect``). That is the reference's
  ``isct`` flag, and it is what splits direct from indirect light in a single
  pass -- the reference never runs two productions.

Statistics: the reference quotes ~1e8 events, which is the dominant cost of
the whole tuning exercise and scales with detector volume. :func:`plan` sizes a
run from a target photon count so a reduced first pass can validate the chain
before committing to the full one.

    :func:`translate_uniform` throws almost everything away for this purpose:
    only ~8 in 100000 direct detected photons were emitted within 150 cm of the
    sensor they hit, because volume-uniform vertices send most light to sensors
    too far off to lie in any shell. Drawing the vertex inside the shell raises
    the in-shell yield by ~100x for the same photon count.

    The draw is uniform in shell VOLUME over the sensor's inward hemisphere, and
    vertices outside the region :func:`translate_uniform` samples are rejected --
    so this reproduces what uniform placement would have put in that shell, only
    far more often. The measured cos(eta) shape is therefore unchanged, including
    its depletion edge, which is geometry rather than statistics and so does not
    fill in with more events.

    ``event_id`` gives each photon's event, and every event gets its **own**

    sample: the spherical-shell construction behind the angular response is
    only valid when sources are uniform in the volume around each PMT, because
    that is what makes the source distribution flat in cos(eta). Shifting a
    whole chunk by one draw collapses thousands of events onto a single vertex
    and the measured spectrum then reflects those few positions, not the
    photosensor. Omitting it keeps the old single-shift behaviour, which is
    only meaningful when the array really is one event.

    The volume is the one both tables are binned on, so there is no fiducial
    margin to choose: ``scatTableLooper.C`` sets ``rmax = cylRadius - tuberadius``
    and ``zmax = tubezpos - tuberadius``, filling the cylinder right up to the
    sensor faces. Holding sources further in is not the conservative choice it
    looks like -- it empties the small angular-response shells, and ``fit_cos.C``
    fits the 100 cm one.
