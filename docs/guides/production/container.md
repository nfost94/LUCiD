# Produce a dataset from the container

Everything needed to generate WAND events lives in one image: LUCiD, PhotonSim,
Geant4 and the configs. You need the image and a writable output directory —
nothing else, no checkout, no build. Works with Apptainer (HPC) or Docker.

This page is about producing data by hand. Driving a batch farm is a separate
concern; see [deploy-lxplus.md](deploy-lxplus.md) and friends. For a host-native
install without a container, see [local.md](local.md).

## 1. Get the image

Pick a release tag, not `latest`, so your data is traceable to a known build.

**Download the prebuilt `.sif`** — the quickest route, and the one to use if
you do not have ~30 GB of scratch. It is a plain HTTPS download from the CERNBox
public share, no account or token needed:

```bash
curl -fSL --retry 3 -C - -o lucid_v0.1.0.sif \
  https://cernbox.cern.ch/remote.php/dav/public-files/vOhH8P78hnSQKNZ/containers/lucid_v0.1.0.sif
```

`-C -` resumes a partial download, so an interrupted 3.4 GB transfer can be
restarted with the same command. This is the same share
`scripts/download_data.sh` uses for the example ROOT and SIREN files.

Check what you got against the published checksum:

```bash
curl -fsSL -O https://cernbox.cern.ch/remote.php/dav/public-files/vOhH8P78hnSQKNZ/containers/MD5SUMS.txt
md5sum -c MD5SUMS.txt
```

**Or build the `.sif` yourself** from the published image:

```bash
apptainer build lucid_v0.1.0.sif docker://ghcr.io/cider-ml/lucid:v0.1.0
```

Budget ~30 GB of scratch and a few tens of minutes: the layers unpack to ~27 GB
before being squashed back to ~3.5 GB. `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` must point somewhere
with that much room.

**Docker/podman** skip the build entirely — pull and go (~4 GB, ~10 GB free
needed):

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/cider-ml/lucid:v0.1.0
```

The image is `linux/amd64`; conda-forge ships no `geant4` for `linux-aarch64`.
On Apple Silicon install Rosetta 2
(`softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`) and enable *Use Rosetta
for x86/amd64 emulation* in Docker Desktop → Settings → General. Expect 70–80%
of native speed — fine for test runs.

The image can tell you what it is:

```bash
apptainer exec lucid_v0.1.0.sif cat /opt/VERSIONS
```

## 2. Run one job

```bash
mkdir -p out
apptainer exec -B "$PWD/out:/out" lucid_v0.1.0.sif \
    lucid-run-job \
      --config /opt/LUCiD/lucid/production/configs/GeV/01_pbomb.json \
      --detector SK_WAND \
      --output-dir /out \
      --job-id 1 \
      --n-events 20 \
      --master-seed 12345
```

The Docker equivalent — same arguments, different mount syntax:

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 -v "$PWD/out:/out" \
    ghcr.io/cider-ml/lucid:v0.1.0 \
    lucid-run-job --config /opt/LUCiD/lucid/production/configs/GeV/01_pbomb.json \
                  --detector SK_WAND --output-dir /out --job-id 1 --n-events 20
```

It prints three stages — Geant4 macro, PhotonSim, LUCiD writer — and ends with a
line starting `OK`. Anything else means it failed; the exit code is non-zero.

Two arguments are not optional in practice:

- `--detector` has no useful default. It selects the geometry **and** the
  digitizer and trigger, so getting it wrong silently produces a different
  detector's data. Use `SK_WAND` or `HK_WAND`.
- `--master-seed` defaults to random. Set it if you want to be able to
  reproduce the job.

## 3. The configs

| config | contents | energies (kinetic) | split |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GeV/01_pbomb.json` | 1–5 particles from {e-, e+, mu-, mu+, pi+, pi-, pi0, gamma} at one vertex | 1–2000 e, 200–2000 mu/pi, 1–2130 gamma | train + test |
| `GeV/02_mu.json` | single mu, charge sampled per event from {mu-, mu+} | 200–2000 | test |
| `GeV/03_pi.json` | single charged pi, charge sampled per event from {pi+, pi-} | 200–2000 | test |
| `GeV/04_e.json` | single e, charge sampled per event from {e-, e+} | 1–2000 | test |
| `GeV/06_pi0.json` | single pi0 | 200–2000 | test |
| `GeV/07_gamma.json` | single gamma | 1–2130 | test |

01 is the training set — it mixes species and multiplicities the way a real
interaction does. 02–07 are one-species evaluation sets, one per member of the
01 pool.

Both lepton and pion charges are in the pool, and the single-species sets sample
the charge per event rather than fixing it. Cherenkov light carries no charge
information, so a set of one charge only measures half of what reconstruction is
asked to do — and the charges are not interchangeable at the end of the range:
mu- captures on oxygen while mu+ always yields its decay electron, and pi- is
captured by a nucleus while pi+ decays to mu+ nu. The charge-sampled sets are
what state how often each signature appears.

Sampling is expressed through the bomb source with `min_particles =
max_particles = 1`, not through a two-entry `particles` list: `generate_macro.py`
emits one `/gun/addPrimary` per list entry, so a list of {e-, e+} would put
*both* charges in every event. `03_pi.json` replaces the former
`03_pi_plus.json` / `05_pi_minus.json` pair.

Blocks other than `GeV` exist (`Solar`, `SN`, `Test`); those declare their own
detector and are not part of WAND.

## 4. Detectors

`--detector NAME` reads `config/NAME_geom_config.json` and
`config/NAME_physics_config.json` from inside the image.

| detector | PMTs | digitizer | trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SK_WAND` | 11096 | `ski` | 200 ns window, n_thr 25 |
| `HK_WAND` | 19746 | `hk` | 200 ns window, n_thr 45 |

These are frozen descriptions: they pin the optics, digitizer and trigger so a
rerun cannot drift when the generic `SK`/`HK` configs are edited. Use them.

A dataset config carries no detector of its own, so `--detector` is what decides
it. Passing a non-`*_WAND` detector to one of these configs is refused rather
than silently run, because the generic descriptions carry no digitizer or
trigger and you would get `basic` digitization with no readout trigger.

## 5. Changing things

- **More events**: `--n-events N`. Cost is roughly linear; the bomb runs
  ~10–30 s/event depending on detector and energies.
- **Fixed energy**: `--override-energy-MeV 500` forces monoenergetic primaries.
- **Keep the intermediate ROOT**: `--keep-root`. It is large (~10 MB/event) and
  deleted by default.
- **Your own config**: copy one out of the image, edit, and bind it back in:

  ```bash
  apptainer exec lucid_v0.1.0.sif \
      cat /opt/LUCiD/lucid/production/configs/GeV/02_mu.json > mine.json
  # edit mine.json
  apptainer exec -B "$PWD:/w" lucid_v0.1.0.sif \
      lucid-run-job --config /w/mine.json --detector SK_WAND \
        --output-dir /w/out --job-id 1 --n-events 20
  ```

  The fields worth touching are `particles` (type and energy range),
  `nominal_train`/`nominal_test`, and `selection`. Leave `digitizer` and
  `trigger` out — they come from the detector.

- **Shared overlap cache**: the first job on a fresh install computes a lookup
  table. Release images ship it warm. If you need to relocate it, the order is
  `$LUCID_OVERLAP_CACHE_DIR` → install dir if writable →
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/lucid/spatial_overlap_integrals`.

## 6. Dev loop — run your own checkout

To exercise local edits without rebuilding, bind your clone over `/opt/LUCiD`:

```bash
apptainer exec -B "$PWD/LUCiD:/opt/LUCiD" -B "$PWD/out:/out" lucid_v0.1.0.sif \
    lucid-run-job --config /opt/LUCiD/lucid/production/configs/GeV/02_mu.json \
      --detector SK_WAND --output-dir /out --job-id 1 --test
```

For a PhotonSim source edit, bind it too and rebuild in place; the baked
`/opt/PhotonSim/build` stays intact so incremental compiles take under a minute:

```bash
apptainer exec -B "$PWD/PhotonSim:/opt/PhotonSim" -B "$PWD/out:/out" \
    lucid_v0.1.0.sif bash -c \
    "cmake --build /opt/PhotonSim/build -j && lucid-run-job ..."
```

Note that a bind-mounted checkout is writable, so the overlap cache lands there
rather than in the user cache — see §5.

## 7. Where the output goes

`--output-dir` is written directly, as four HDF5 files:

```
<output-dir>/
  sensor/wc_sensor_0000.h5    digitized PMT hits (charge, time)
  hits/wc_hits_0000.h5        per-digit truth decomposition
  step/wc_step_0000.h5        Geant4 steps + per-step photon counts
  labl/wc_labl_0000.h5        event/interaction/track labels
```

The `0000` is `file_index = job-id - 1`, so parallel jobs writing to one
directory each need a distinct `--job-id`.

Every file records what produced it:

```bash
python3 -c "
import h5py; a=h5py.File('out/sensor/wc_sensor_0000.h5')['config'].attrs
print({k: a[k] for k in ('git_commit','digitizer_model','n_sensors','trigger_n_thr')})"
```

Note that events failing the trigger are dropped, so the stored event count can
be lower than `--n-events`. `labl`'s `config/source_event_idx` maps each stored
event back to its generated index — use it to join datasets, never shard
position, since two detectors drop different events.

For what is inside each file, see
[dataset-schema.md](../../reference/dataset-schema.md).

## Building the image yourself

Only needed if you are changing the `Dockerfile`. Clone LUCiD and PhotonSim as
siblings and build from the parent directory:

```bash
mkdir lucid-work && cd lucid-work
git clone https://github.com/CIDeR-ML/LUCiD.git
git clone https://github.com/cesarjesusvalls/PhotonSim.git
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --provenance=false --sbom=false \
    -f LUCiD/container/Dockerfile -t lucid:dev .
```

`--provenance=false --sbom=false` suppresses BuildKit attestation manifests;
ghcr.io stalls on them for this package. Expect ~10 min cold; rebuilds reuse
layers, and editing LUCiD source retriggers only the last one.

## Troubleshooting

- **`exec /bin/bash: exec format error`** — Apple Silicon without Rosetta
  enabled in Docker Desktop. See §1.
- **`Error: detector needs to be specified`** — the GeV configs declare no
  detector; pass `--detector SK_WAND` or `HK_WAND`.
- **`is not a frozen *_WAND description`** — you passed `--detector SK` or
  `HK`. Those carry no digitizer or trigger, so the run would silently produce
  undigitized, untriggered data. Use the `*_WAND` names.
- **`Read-only file system: .../spatial_overlap_integrals`** — an image
  predating v0.1.0. Either upgrade, or point `LUCID_OVERLAP_CACHE_DIR` at a
  writable directory.
- **BuildKit silence during source builds** — long compile steps buffer output;
  use `--progress=plain`.
- **"No space left on device"** — `docker system prune -af` reclaims old layers.
