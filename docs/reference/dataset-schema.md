# LUCiD Dataset Layout

This document describes the concrete HDF5 schema for LUCiD water-Cherenkov
simulation output, produced by the
[LUCiD](https://github.com/CIDeR-ML/LUCiD) production pipeline using PhotonSim ROOT files
as input.

The design splits detector output into four parallel HDF5 files -- raw sensor
readout, per-particle signal decomposition, 3D track segments, and labels --
so that each ML task can load only the modalities it needs. This document
specifies the LUCiD-specific instantiation of that design.

## Overview

LUCiD output for one batch consists of four parallel HDF5 files, all sharing
the same per-event indexing:

```
dataset_root/
├── sensor/    wc_sensor_NNNN.h5    — raw PMT readout (post-smearing)
├── hits/      wc_hits_NNNN.h5      — per-particle decomposition of PMT signal
├── step/      wc_step_NNNN.h5       — 3D track segments (Geant4 truth)
└── labl/      wc_labl_NNNN.h5      — labels, truth metadata, dimension tables
```

Each file is independently loadable. Each file contains a `config/` group
holding file-level metadata and a sequence of `event_NNN/` groups (NNN is the
sequence position in the file, zero-padded).

## Standard conventions

These apply across all four files:

- **Group naming**: `event_000/`, `event_001/`, ... — sequence positions, not
  canonical event IDs. The canonical PhotonSim entry index is the
  `source_event_idx` attribute on each group and listed in the file-level
  `config/source_event_idx` array.
- **Index locality**: every index column inside `event_NNN/` ranges over
  `[0, count_for_this_event)`. No global IDs are used as indices anywhere.
- **Foreign keys**: cross-table joins within an event use FK columns
  (`particle_idx`, `track_idx`) rather than CSR offset arithmetic.
- **Time convention**: all times in `sensor/`, `hits/`, and `step/` are stored
  in the **detector frame** — the per-event `t0` offset has been added at
  write time. The truth `t0` itself lives in `labl/event_NNN/per_event/t0`.
- **Cross-file alignment**: parallel filenames (`*_NNNN.h5`) and matching
  `event_NNN/` group names align modalities. Each `event_NNN/` carries an
  `source_event_idx` attribute that loaders cross-check.
- **Emission-process encoding**: per-row `emission_process: int8` columns on
  `hits/` and `step/sensor_hits/` tag what produced each charge contribution.
  Enum: `0 = Cherenkov`, `1 = scintillation`, `2 = dark noise` (electronics, on
  `hits/` only — dark has no segment). A given `(particle_idx, sensor_idx,
  digit_idx)` (or `(segment_idx, sensor_idx, digit_idx)`) key can appear in
  multiple rows differing only in `emission_process` when more than one process
  contributes. Cherenkov-only datasets carry the column with all-zeros so
  consumers can group/filter by it without a presence check. Pre-Phase-0
  datasets that lack the column read as all-zeros via the reader's backward-
  compat default.

## Provenance block (every file's `config/`)

The following attrs appear on `config/` of every file:

- `format_version` (int)
- `n_events` (int)
- `git_commit` (str) — LUCiD repository commit
- `reflection_model` (str) — reflection model used (`scalar_mix` default, `scalar`, or `angular`) — distinguishes datasets by reflection physics
- `run_id` (str) — unique batch identifier
- `dataset_name` (str)
- `file_index` (int) — NNNN of `wc_*_NNNN.h5`
- `source_file` (str) — input PhotonSim ROOT path
- `lucid_master_seed` (int) — JAX PRNG root seed for this batch
- `photonsim_seed` (int, optional) — Geant4 seed used when generating the
  source ROOT file. `-1` if not propagated.

Plus a per-file `source_event_idx (n_events,) uint32` array in `config/`
for integrity checks and fast event enumeration.

## File schemas

### `sensor.h5` — recorded PMT digits (hit-making output)

Post-smearing, t0-shifted. This is what the detector electronics record — a
list of **digits** produced by the digitizer (see `lucid/simulation/digitizer.py`).
A digit is one recorded hit: charge integrated over a per-sensor time window at
its first-arrival time. **A `sensor_idx` may appear in more than one row** when
light arrives in well-separated time clusters (delayed coincidence, pile-up,
dark noise). The `basic` model (default) uses an infinite window, so it yields
exactly one digit per sensor — the legacy one-hit-per-sensor behaviour.

```
sensor.h5
├── config/
│   ├── attrs: provenance + n_sensors, detector_type, material,
│   │           smearing_applied, smearing_charge_function, smearing_time_function,
│   │           digitizer_model   — "basic" | "ski" | "hk"
│   ├── source_event_idx      (n_events,) uint32
│   └── sensor_positions      (n_sensors, 3) float32
└── event_NNN/
    │ attrs: source_event_idx, n_hits   (= number of digits)
    ├── sensor_idx            (n_hits,) uint16   — PMT index; may repeat (multi-hit)
    ├── PE                    (n_hits,) float32   — digit charge (post readout resolution)
    └── T                     (n_hits,) float32   — digit first-arrival time, detector frame
```

Notes:
- `sensor_idx` is the PMT index (0..n_sensors-1); one row per **digit**, not per PMT.
- `hits.h5` / `step.h5` rows carry a `digit_idx` FK into this file's per-event
  digit list, decomposing each digit's charge by source (and dark noise).
- Digitizer model + electronics parameters come from the detector physics
  config's optional `"digitizer"` block; absent ⇒ `basic`.
- Sensor file is the only file that needs smearing parameters in its config.
- **Readout trigger** (optional `"trigger"` block in the physics config; provenance
  in `config/` attrs `trigger*`): a sliding-window coincidence trigger keeps only
  in-gate digits and **drops events that don't trigger** (they are absent, leaving
  gaps in `source_event_idx`). Triggered datasets write digits in a **canonical
  `(window_idx, sensor_idx, T)` order**, so each readout window is a contiguous
  digit slice (see `labl/…/per_window`) and a PMT's hits within a window are
  time-ordered. Untriggered datasets keep the digitizer's native order.

### `hits.h5` — per-particle PMT decomposition

Pre-smearing per-particle contributions to the PMT signal. This is
the truth-level sensor decomposition by source particle.

```
hits.h5
├── config/
│   ├── attrs: provenance + n_sensors, detector_type, material
│   ├── source_event_idx      (n_events,) uint32
│   └── sensor_positions      (n_sensors, 3) float32   — duplicated for standalone use
└── event_NNN/
    │ attrs: source_event_idx, n_particles, n_particle_hits
    ├── particle_idx          (n_particle_hits,) int32   — local FK to labl/per_particle row; -1 for dark noise
    ├── digit_idx             (n_particle_hits,) int32   — FK to sensor.h5 digit (which recorded hit)
    ├── sensor_idx            (n_particle_hits,) uint16
    ├── PE                    (n_particle_hits,) float32   — pre-smearing per-source contribution
    ├── T                     (n_particle_hits,) float32   — pre-smearing per-source, detector frame
    └── emission_process      (n_particle_hits,) int8     — 0=Cherenkov, 1=scintillation, 2=dark noise
```

Notes:
- Each row is one `(source, sensor, digit, emission_process)` contribution;
  summing `PE` over the rows of a given `(sensor_idx, digit_idx)` gives that
  `sensor.h5` digit's charge. **Dark noise** is a labelled source:
  `emission_process = 2` with `particle_idx = -1` (no owning particle / segment),
  so "dark contribution to a recorded hit" = filter `emission_process == 2`.
- `particle_idx` is local to the event (`0..n_particles-1`).
- A `(particle_idx, sensor_idx)` pair can appear in **multiple rows** differing
  only in `emission_process` when both processes contribute to that sensor from
  that particle. Cherenkov-only datasets emit one row per pair, all with
  `emission_process = 0`. Aggregating PE/T over the `emission_process` axis
  recovers a process-agnostic per-(particle, sensor) view.
- Loaders that train on `hits/` alone use `sensor_positions` from this file's
  `config/` to map `sensor_idx` to physical positions.

### `step.h5` — 3D Geant4 track segments

Per-segment truth from Geant4: trajectory geometry, energy deposition,
direction, kinetic state.

    └── sensor_hits/                — flat per-(segment, sensor, digit) PE/T (n_segment_hits rows)
        │ attrs: n_segment_hits
        ├── segment_idx           (n_segment_hits,) int32  — FK to this event's segments (0..n_segments-1)
        ├── digit_idx             (n_segment_hits,) int32  — FK to the sensor.h5 digit
        ├── sensor_idx            (n_segment_hits,) uint16 — FK to sensor_positions
        ├── PE                    (n_segment_hits,) float32 — segment's contribution to that (sensor, digit) PE
        ├── T                     (n_segment_hits,) float32 — segment's first-arrival time in that digit (ns, detector frame)
        └── emission_process      (n_segment_hits,) int8    — 0=Cherenkov, 1=scintillation
```

Notes:
- `track_idx` is local; ranges `0..n_tracks-1`. Joins to `labl/event_NNN/per_track/`.
- `beta_start` is the particle's β at the start of the segment — sufficient to
  reconstruct Cherenkov physics (opening angle, photon yield, spectrum) outside
  Geant4. Storing per-segment beta avoids re-deriving it from the kinetic
  energy and mass, and keeps each segment self-contained for forward-simulation
  tasks.
- `n_cherenkov` is Geant4's exact count for this segment — direct truth label
  for forward-simulation ML.
- Each segment row is one raw G4 sub-step (PhotonSim ships unmerged
  segments; the prior in-PhotonSim merger now runs in Python at
  ingestion time — see `lucid/sources/segment_grouping.py`).
  `group_id` holds the merger's output: aggregating segments by
  `group_id` (start = first row's start, end = last row's end, edep
  and n_cherenkov summed, dir / beta_start / time = first row's value)
  reproduces the coarser pre-merge schema. Group ids are contiguous
  within an event (`0..n_groups-1`) and never re-used across tracks.
  Consumers should pick whichever granularity their task needs.
- Segments are physically ordered by track (so segments belonging to track k
  appear contiguously), but the ordering is **not** required for correctness
  — `track_idx` is the canonical link. Loaders may shuffle segments freely.
- `sensor_hits/` is the per-(segment, sensor) ground truth that `hits.h5`
  is aggregated from: aggregating `sensor_hits.PE` over `segment_idx →
  track_idx → particle_idx` reproduces `hits.h5/event_NNN/PE` exactly
  (column-sums match `sensor.h5/event_NNN/PE` by construction — shared
  `qe_weights` in `sensor_response.make_hits_per_segment`). Mandatory in
  data-mode datasets — re-bucketing into a different particle definition
  is a Python re-aggregation over the same on-disk file.

### `labl.h5` — labels and truth dimension tables

Multi-granularity truth: per-event scalars, per-particle metadata, per-track
metadata.

```

Notes:
- `label_names` (config attr) is a small list of column names within
  `per_particle/` and `per_track/` that count as classification label schemes
  (as opposed to truth metadata or join keys). For LUCiD currently:
  `["category"]`. Added if more taxonomies are introduced (e.g.,
  `["category", "shower_or_track"]`).
- The two granularities reflect a real LUCiD distinction:
  - **Particles** (`per_particle`) are Geant4-categorized objects (Primary,
    DecayElectron, SecondaryPion, Gamma) — typically ~8 per event. Used to
    decompose the PMT signal in `hits/`.
  - **Tracks** (`per_track`) are full Geant4 tracks — typically ~600 per
    event. The 3D truth in `step/` is organized at this granularity.

  "The reconstructed track" (what a vertex/energy/direction fit targets — a
  primary and its physically meaningful decay products) lives at the
  **`per_particle`** granularity, *not* the ~600 `per_track` Geant4 sub-tracks:
  the ~600 rows are the raw simulation bookkeeping (every delta ray, every
  scattered secondary), which is why `hits/` decomposes by `particle_idx`, not
  `track_idx`.
- Each track maps to exactly one particle via `particle_idx`. The mapping is
  derived at write time by walking the parent chain from each track until it
  reaches a categorized particle. Verified injective on production data
  (>99.9% of tracks map cleanly; orphan housekeeping tracks are flagged as
  `particle_idx = -1`).
- `genealogy_data` is the compressed chain through categorized particles only.
  `ext_genealogy_data` is the full Geant4 chain through all intermediate
  meaningful tracks. Both are kept; they answer different questions.
- `track_id` is the Geant4 ID (sparse integers up to ~10⁶). It is **not** used
  as an index anywhere — purely truth metadata.

## Cross-modality joins

For an event:

```
hits hit (h)  ──particle_idx[h]──►  labl/per_particle row (p)
step segment (s)  ──track_idx[s]──►  labl/per_track row (k)
labl/per_track row (k)  ──particle_idx[k]──►  labl/per_particle row (p)
```

All joins are local-integer-index lookups within the same event. No offset
arithmetic, no graph walking, no cross-event references.
