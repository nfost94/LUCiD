# The photon pipeline

LUCiD's forward model is a single differentiable pipeline, JIT-compiled and vectorized
(`jax.jit` / `vmap` / `lax.scan`) so gradients flow end to end:

```
sources  →  propagation  →  photon_step (× K)  →  sensor_response
(emit rays)  (ray–geometry)  (scatter/reflect/    (aggregate → per-PMT
              intersection)   absorb, soft weights)  charge & first-arrival time)
```

- **`lucid/sources/`** emits photon rays — from the SIREN track/cascade emitter, or from
  calibration sources (laser, isotropic), or from PhotonSim data.
- **`lucid/propagation/`** intersects rays with the detector geometry and iterates `K` scatter
  bounces. In the closed surface detectors a photon emitted outside the detector volume, for
  instance by a track that leaves it, carries no weight: the inner detector is optically sealed.
  String telescopes are open media and keep every photon.
- **`lucid/simulation/photon_step.py`** does the per-step physics — scatter, reflect, absorb —
  with *soft* weights (a `temperature` controls the softness) so the whole thing is
  differentiable rather than a hard Monte-Carlo branch. Where a branch stays genuinely
  discrete, its gradient is carried by a DiCE score correction — the same technique the
  architecture page calls "DiCE soft weights".
- **`lucid/simulation/sensor_response.py`** aggregates photon weights into per-PMT charge and a
  soft-min first-arrival time.

For **data production** there is one more, non-differentiable stage after the simulator
kernel: **`lucid/simulation/digitizer.py`** decomposes the per-PMT signal into digits (SPE
charge sampling, per-sensor time-window integration, dark noise) and
**`lucid/simulation/trigger.py`** applies an optional sliding-window readout trigger. These
model detector electronics for dataset realism; the differentiable inference path stops at
`sensor_response`. See the [dataset schema](../reference/dataset-schema.md) for what they write.

## The one entry point: `setup_event_simulator`

`lucid.simulation.setup_event_simulator(json_filename, ...)` is the hub. It reads the geometry
JSON, builds the detector, picks the propagator, wires the photon source, and returns a
**JIT-compiled callable**. Its mode flags determine the behaviour and the call signature:

| Mode | flag | callable signature |
|------|------|--------------------|
| Track (reconstruction) | `hit_mode='per_photon'` | `(particle_params, detector_params, key) → (charge, time)` |
| Calibration | `is_calibration=True`, `hit_mode='aggregated'` | `(source, detector_params, key) → (charge, time)` |
| Data-like | `is_data=True`, `hit_mode='realistic'` | `(particle_params, detector_params, key, photon_data) → (charge, time)` |

The table shows the three everyday modes; `hit_mode` has more values for special outputs —
`moments` (charge moments per PMT), `per_segment` (per-(track-segment, sensor) attribution for
dataset production), `waveform`/`waveform_expected` (time-binned waveforms), and
`shotgun_per_photon` (per-photon records for diagnostics).

Other important arguments: `n_photons`, `K` (scatter iterations), `temperature` (soft→hard),
`wavelength_mode` (per-photon λ physics vs scalar), `default_detector_params` (bake the detector
params in so the callable drops that argument), and `detector_type`.

Four more arguments are easy to miss but change the numbers you get out:

- **`use_expected_value`** (default `True`) — `True` runs the *mean-field* forward: each photon
  carries a deterministic soft weight, so the output is the expected charge/time with **no shot
  noise**. `False` switches the per-step scatter/absorb branches to Monte-Carlo *sampling*, so
  the output fluctuates event-to-event like real data. Data mode (`is_data=True`) always samples.
  If you are generating a *truth* dataset that should look shot-noisy, sample it — set
  `use_expected_value=False` (or use `is_data=True`); the mean-field forward is for the
  differentiable inference path, where you want a smooth loss surface, not fluctuations.
- **`max_candidates_per_ray`** (default `4`) — the per-cell sensor cap in the spatial-hash grid the
  propagator uses to find which PMTs a ray can hit. If a grid cell ends up holding more sensors
  than this cap, the extras are **silently dropped** from that cell's candidate list (the geometry
  validator emits a warning when this happens). This is the second, quieter cause of a
  "why are no PMTs lit?" surprise — the first being photons that never reach a sensor. Densely
  packed layouts (mPMT domes) may need a larger cap; the geometry builders scale the grid cell size
  with this value.
- **`apply_smearing`** (default `True`, data mode only) — toggles the SK-like per-PMT charge and
  time smearing applied inside the realistic (`is_data=True`) hit-maker. `False` returns the raw
  hard first-arrival time and summed charge (Bernoulli-QE-sampled but un-smeared) — useful when you
  want data-mode sampling without the electronics resolution folded in.
- **`deposit_leg_bound`** (default `False`) — weights a sensor candidate by its distance from the
  segment the photon actually travelled, instead of from the photon's infinite ray line, which at
  grazing incidence passes near sensors further along the wall than the photon ever reached.
  **Production sets it `True`** (`DEPOSIT_LEG_BOUND` in `lucid/production/run_job.py`), so
  production data carry noticeably less deposited charge than the library default gives. The string (telescope) propagator has its own deposit and ignores it.

### Choosing `n_photons`, `K`, `temperature`

These three are performance-vs-fidelity knobs. Honest rules of thumb from how the repo's own
workflows set them:

- **`n_photons`** — enough that the per-PMT statistics are not the limiting noise. In-tree
  examples run from ~200–250k (display/quickstart) up to ~1M (`setup_event_simulator`'s own
  default); reconstruction sweeps use ~600k. More photons is strictly smoother and slower; scale it
  up until the quantity you care about stops moving.
- **`K`** (scatter iterations) — the number of scatter bounces the transport unrolls. Display and
  quick looks use `K=6`; reconstruction uses `K≥8` so the late-scattered tail is faithful. `K` is
  a hard truncation: photons that would scatter more than `K` times are simply cut, so under-setting
  it biases the long-time / wide-angle tail. For string (telescope) geometries, `compute_K_min`
  (`lucid/geometry/string_sizing.py`) picks the smallest `K` with `p_scat**K ≤ eps_K` — i.e. `K`
  large enough that the residual un-terminated weight is below a floor — which for a long ~20-string
  telescope tends to land higher than the water-tank display value.
- **`temperature`** — the soft-assignment softness. `temperature=None` gives **hard** (step-function)
  photon→sensor assignment and hard first-arrival timing — the non-differentiable *truth* readout;
  in-tree data/truth simulators pass `temperature=None`. A small positive value (the recon sweeps use
  `0.1`) softens the assignment just enough for gradients to flow. Lower is more faithful but the
  gradient gets noisier/stiffer; `0.1`–`0.2` is the working range. Use `None` for the forward you
  compare against, a small float for the differentiable prediction you fit.

### The soft-min first-arrival caveat

The differentiable aggregated hit-maker (`make_hits_simulation` in `sensor_response.py`) reports a
**soft-min** first-arrival time, `t_soft = t_min − T·log(Σ_i exp(−(t_i − t_min)/T))`. Because every
term in the sum is ≥ 1 for the earliest photon, `t_soft ≤ t_min`: the soft-min **underestimates the
hard first arrival**, and the gap grows roughly like `T·log(number of contributing photons)` — more
light on a PMT pulls the reported time slightly earlier. This is a differentiability artifact, not
physics. The realistic (data) and moments hit-makers instead read the **hard** geometric
first-arrival (`segment_min`, no soft-min), so use those when you need the true first-photon time.

## Why differentiable?

Because every step is differentiable, `jax.grad` of a loss over the per-PMT output gives exact
gradients with respect to **particle** parameters (energy, vertex, direction, t₀ →
reconstruction) *and* **detector** parameters (scattering, absorption, reflection, QE →
calibration). That is what turns both problems into gradient-based optimization — see
[Reconstruction](../guides/reconstruction.md) and [Calibration](../guides/calibration.md).
